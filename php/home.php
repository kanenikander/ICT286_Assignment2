			<h2> Welcome to NinjaPirate Weapon Emporium Warehouse Outlet! </h2>
			<p>
				Here at NinjaPirate Weapon Emporium Warehouse Outlet we want to ensure
				you have best selection of genuine and replica weapons, armaments and
				accessories. From casual weekend cosplay to LARPs and re-enactments;
				we have something for everyone.
			</p>
			<p>
				We started out as a couple of like-minded individuals who found it
				difficult to find a local store to purchase items for LARP. Ordering
				from online stores was often a trial and error process with items
				varying greatly in quality or just plain not matching their
				description. With many people in our LARP group expressing similar
				frustrations we took it upon ourselves to make the best online store
				we could, with guaranteed quality (we inspect and review every item
				before we sell it!) and accurate descriptions so you know exactly what
				you’re buying.
			</p>
			<p>
				For our genuine items we have teamed up with local smiths, woodworkers
				and tailors to provide a unique service where you can obtain items
				crafted by real masters. If you desire a more customised order we can
				also assist in putting you in touch with the right people for the job
				(although this is subject to their availability).
			</p>
			<p>
				We try to stay involved with our community by running LARP events
				and small festivals where you can come and meet us face-to-face,
				handle our products and share your stories over a flagon (or three)
				of mead. Being an online only store we encourage people to come to
				one of these events to get up close and personal with what we stock
				as sometimes there is just no substitute for swinging a nice piece
				of steel in person. However, if you can’t make it we offer a 30-day
				money-back or exchange policy if you aren’t happy with your purchase
				or it doesn’t fit (but we do ask that items are returned in the same
				condition as they were received).
			</p>

			<h3>Product Range</h3>
			<p>
				We sell replica and hand-made period weaponry. Our current stock
				includes the following production catagories: replica, genuine, and
				reproduction. Replica items are generally mass produced and may not be
				intended to be used as a practical weapon (see individual item
				descriptions for more details). Genuine weapons are generally produced
				by hand, either by one of our suppliers or local smiths; these items are
				typically made to be used for their intended purpose. Finally,
				reproduction items are similar to genuine items but have been produced
				to be a close as possible to their historic counterpart (e.g. we stock
				a Katana that is produced in the same way as the genuine article but it
				is not made in Japan or by a Japanese sword-smith).
			</p>
			<p>
				If you are unsure about any of the items we stock or have further questions before you purchase please feel free to get in touch with our friendly staff at our contact email: sales@ninjapirate.com.au
